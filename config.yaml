# TRAFFIC DETECTOR CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# This file contains all settings for the traffic detection system.
# Adjust these values to customize the behavior for your needs.
# 
# NOTE: You can override these settings by running main.py interactively,
#       or edit this file directly for permanent changes.
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# 📹 VIDEO INPUT SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
video:
  # Directory where input videos are located
  # Common paths: "./data/input_videos" or "./videos"
  input_directory: "./data/input_videos"
  
  # Supported formats: mp4, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv
  # Leave empty to be prompted for file selection
  input_file: ""
  
  # Is this 360-degree footage?
  # Set to true if your video is 360° equirectangular format
  is_360_degree: true

# ============================================================================
# 💾 OUTPUT SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
output:
  # Directory where processed videos and results are saved
  directory: "./data/output"
  
  # Output video format and filename
  # If empty, defaults to: {input_name}_processed.avi
  video_filename: ""
  
  # Save detection results to CSV?
  save_csv: true
  
  # Save detailed breakdown of detections?
  save_detailed_counts: true

# ============================================================================
# 🤖 MODEL SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
model:
  # YOLO model size for vehicle/bicycle detection
  # Options: n (nano), s (small), m (medium), l (large), x (extra-large)
  # Recommendation: 'm' for balanced speed/accuracy, 'l' for better accuracy
  yolo_size: "m"
  
  # Detection confidence threshold (0.1 to 0.9)
  # Higher = fewer detections but more confident
  # Lower = more detections but some might be false positives
  # Recommendation: 0.4 (balanced), 0.5 (more conservative), 0.55 for 360° videos
  confidence_threshold: 0.5

# ============================================================================
# ⚡ PROCESSING OPTIMIZATION
# ============================================================================
processing:
  # Frame skip - process every Nth frame for speed
  # 1 = process every frame (maximum accuracy)
  # 3 = process every 3rd frame (faster - default)
  # 5 = process every 5th frame (much faster, less accurate)
  frame_skip: 3
  
  # Percentage of total frames to process (1-100)
  # 100 = process all frames (default, recommended)
  # 50 = process every other frame (faster)
  process_percentage: 100

# ============================================================================
# 🔍 OBJECT DETECTION SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
detection:
  # Minimum number of frames an object must be detected before counting
  # Higher = fewer false positives but might miss brief objects
  # Recommendation: 3 (balanced default)
  min_hits_before_counting: 3
  
  # Minimum object size in pixels
  # Objects smaller than this are considered too distant and filtered out
  # Recommendation: 40 (balanced), higher values = less clutter
  min_object_size: 40
  
  # Distance filtering sensitivity
  # 1.0 = very strict (closest objects only - best accuracy)
  # 1.5 = moderate (balanced - recommended)
  # 2.0 = loose (include more distant objects)
  distance_filter_sensitivity: 1.5
  
  # Enable debug mode?
  # Shows detailed classification information during processing
  debug_mode: false

# ============================================================================
# 📊 GIS/LOCATION SETTINGS (Optional)
# ============================================================================
gis:
  # Path to GIS metadata CSV file
  # CSV should contain: video_file, location_name, latitude, longitude
  # Leave empty to skip location metadata
  metadata_file: ""
  
  # Example CSV format:
  # video_file,location_name,latitude,longitude
  # video1.mp4,Downtown Street,40.7128,-74.0060
  # video2.mp4,Park Avenue,40.7614,-73.9776

# ============================================================================
# 🎯 DETECTION TARGETS (What to detect and track)
# ============================================================================
targets:
  # Detect and count vehicles
  detect_vehicles: true
  
  # Detect and count bicycles
  detect_bicycles: true
  
  # Classify bicycles into types
  # (standard, slightly_non_standard, highly_non_standard)
  classify_bicycles: true
  
  # Detect parking signs
  detect_signs: true
  
  # Track bicycle parking behavior
  track_parking: true

# ============================================================================
# 💡 TIPS FOR BEGINNERS
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. START WITH DEFAULT VALUES
#    The default settings work well for most scenarios.
# 
# 2. IF PROCESSING IS TOO SLOW
#    - Increase frame_skip to 5 or 10
#    - Reduce process_percentage to 50
#    - Use smaller yolo_size ('s' instead of 'm')
# 
# 3. IF YOU'RE GETTING TOO MANY FALSE DETECTIONS
#    - Increase confidence_threshold to 0.5 or 0.6
#    - Increase min_object_size to 50 or 60
#    - Increase min_hits_before_counting to 2 or 3
# 
# 4. IF YOU'RE MISSING SOME OBJECTS
#    - Decrease confidence_threshold to 0.3 or 0.35
#    - Decrease min_object_size to 30
#    - Use larger yolo_size ('l' instead of 'm')
#
